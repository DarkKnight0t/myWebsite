    <p id="about">
    Hi, my name is Jan Asitimbay and I am currently a junior.
    I attend the High School for Math, Science, and Engineering, one
    of the 9 specialized high schools in New York City. I have many
    interests which include math, science, and coding. 
    I want to major in computer science
    in college. My dream college is MIT. I am not only interested in the academics.
    I am also interested in sports. I play sports casually. I like to go to my nearby 
    park and play some basketball. I also like to watch F1, which is a motorsport.
    The team I support is Oracle Red Bull Racing. To learn more about me you can click
    on the navigation bar above.
